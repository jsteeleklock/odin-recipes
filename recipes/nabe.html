        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the meatballs, finely dice the white part of a green onion. In a bowl, add minced chicken, egg and a handful of breadcrumbs. Season with salt and pepper and add the diced green onion. Add a splash of lemon juice, mix and knead into meatballs around the size of ping-pong balls. </li>
                <li>To start the stock, soak the seaweed in boiling water for 5 minutes. Add soy sauce, ginger, brown sugar, mirin and a splash of sesame oil. </li>
                <li>To prepare tofu, cut a hole in the packet and drain the water out. Empty the tofu onto a chopping board, and cut once horizontally, and then 4 times to make cubes a couple of centimeters thick.</li>
                <li>Cut all the vegetables into chunks. The trick with nabe is to not cut the veg too small. You want big, thich chunks</li>
                <li>Add the stock to a large pot and bring to the boil. Add the vegetables and boil until cooked through.</li>
                <li>Once the veg is cooked, add the meatballs and boil until the chicken is fully cooked through (Remove one and cut open to check)</li>
                <li>Ladle out portions of the soup with veg into individual bowls.Enjoy with a bowl of rice</li>
                <li>Once all of the meat and veg is finished, the remaining stock can be re-used by adding noodles or rice</li>
            </ol>
